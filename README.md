# Blackjack
This is a simple command line base Blackjack game. Cards are represented via their unicode representations. 

Currently, it is possible to play one round of blackjack, although test coverage is still somewhat poor so I'm sure there many bugs.

There are also several improvements I'd like to make. Some major things are:
- Testing and implementing multiplayer support
- Expand test coverage in general
- Figure out some graceful way to play multiple rounds
